Cutting Stock Problem (1D) algorithms implemented with Python 3

## Purpose
The intent of this project is to code algorithm solutions the [Cutting Stock Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem), an area of operations research.  

In short, the Cutting Stock Problem is a problem where we have material (like a metal pipe, or wood boards) which needs to be cut into pieces. These pieces should be laid out, across several boards, such that we can minimize wasted material (bits to short to use).

Code should be correct, readable, easy to use, and well-commented.

## Algorithms

### 1. First-fit Algorithm
This is the first algorithm implemented, a "hello world" of sorts. The First-fit Algorithm is a type of greedy approximation algorithm. It's called ["greedy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) because it optimizes at each step of calculation without considering the solution as a while. Furthermore, even as a greedy algorithm its only an approximation of the optimal result. Namely, at each step we don't check which piece fits best, it's just first-come-first-served!

Here's how it works:  

1. Sorts input pieces by size  
2. Creates the first Board which will be output  
3. Tries to arrange the largest item on the Board  
4. If there is space, the item is placed.  
5. If there is no space, a new Board is taken off the shelf and the item is added there.  
6. Repeat #3-5 for each item. Returns solution. Done.  

Interestingly, Fit-first has been shown to always give results within 20-25% of the truly optimal solution.
